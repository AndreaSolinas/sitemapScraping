# Scraper for publication control and SEO elements

I examine the sitemap and take the published articles, the time, and the domain.

This version is intended to achieve clean code, with separation between levels.
Furthermore, in this version, the parameterization of configurations is to be used, which is why environment variables
(`.env`) and `.yaml` files for configurations have been introduced.
